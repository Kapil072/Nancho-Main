<P><B>Book Description</B><BR>


This encyclopedic volume presents and analyzes many diverse facts about cells,
organs, organisms, groups, organizations, societies, and supranational
systems, but it integrates all this knowledge into a single conceptual
system. The book is a presentation of the state of current knowledge in
all of the sciences relevant to these seven levels of living systems. It
also provides a theoretical integration and a methodological approach to
quantitative basic research, and how applied research and development can
arise from this. The set of concepts presented by the author is powerful
and draws attention to all facets of a given problem in a social system.</P>

<P> <B>Nancho Comment<BR>
</B>
A pioneering effort to show the commonalities of all living systems, and to develop a typology of their common functions and physiologies. Dr. Miller presided over a fractious team of 100 researchers in seven different fields, many of whom never got the hang of his interdisciplinary vision and stuck rather stubbornly to their narrow classical paradigms and perspectives. (Socilogists didn't know much about biology and thus were loathe to admit its relevence for understanding phenomena in their field. Ditto for biologists and psychology, physicians and political economy. ) The flow, therefore, is choppy and unpersuasive, and only unified by Miller's heroic post-project efforts to bind these belligerantly diverse fields together with a common new (and pretty clunky) vocabulary. This is the direction of the future, however, and this book deserves considerable veneration for starting the ball rolling.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Nancho Comment</STRONG><BR>
Incredible! Chance and Jolly (great pair up or what?), two of the most respected voices in modern anthropology write THE BREAKTHROUGH WORK on attention and its dominant role in creating, maintaining and overthrowing social structures, and instead of receiving a Nobel Prize their blessed book is ridiculed, attacked and remaindered. Think about it. More than any other single factor, our attention determines the content of our consciousness from moment to moment, and thus determines our experience, our memories, and finally our lives. Attention creatively nourishes the beings and tasks that receive it. Its channeling and command is the secret of all entertainment, leadership and organizational management. It is what advertisers spend billions of dollars each year to buy from publications, broadcast outlets and Internet sites. In short, it is humanity's most important social and existential resource and yet who in the world is studying it? Where it goes and how it is controlled should be a central issue in psychology, sociology and political science, yet when is the last time you saw a documentary, book or even article on it? Strange, no? Because there appears to be a widespread hunger for that kind of knowledge. The Celestine Prophecy proved that, if nothing else. But try to launch that discussion in academia today like Chance and Jolly did, and you risk professional destruction. Anyway, find and read their books or as a poor substitute read my riff on the phenomenon in the <A href="${BASE_URL}arcmain.html#kipapers">Ki Papers</A>.

by Stanley Milgram
                    <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Nancho Comment</STRONG><BR>
Finally some psychology relevent to our planetary plight. Milgram's extraordinary and often replicated studies show that we as a species seem to be divided into relatively equal thirds with regard to empathy/obedience - 1/3 who will refuse to inflict pain on others despite official pressure to do so, 1/3 who will object/question/protest but ultimately obey if an "authority" insists, and 1/3 who will obey almost any "authority" reflexively and execute orders to harm others quite indifferently (including a few percent who really get into it).  So, people, this is "us" and our raw material for building a brave new world. Big Body builders thus have a decided advantage - a vast readymade population of obedient candidates to choose from - easily incorporated "members" who will cheerfully pillage, impoverish, or pollute "other" peoples on command of authoritative corporate leaders.<P>
 Our challenge as empathic "refuseniks" within a democratic society is the batlle for the hearts and minds of the conscientious but weak middle third. If we can strengthen their resolve (unbreak their balls, as it were), we have a clear majority that can legitimately command authority and thus legally/ethically/psychologically control the other morally anaesthetized third. Read the reader comments below, study the book, and meditate on what you can do to help. The Great Work begins here.<P>
<STRONG>Reader Responses</STRONG><BR>
                    "<STRONG>An intense, haunting, and enlightening illumination</STRONG>. 
                    Stanley Milgram's experiments in human response to authority in the 1970's offer as
                    much insight today as when they were originally conducted. The experiments are best
                    known as a series of tests performed through Yale University, where a subject was told
                    to administer an increasingly high level of electrical shock to a victim attempting to learn
                    a series of word relationships. The frightening results showed the majority of subjects,
                    at the bequest of the authority involved, applied maximum voltage despite the begging
                    and pleading of the victim to stop the test (the victim being an actor pretending to be
                    shocked)...
                    We still have a lot to learn from the evidence gathered by Milgram. His book presents
                    scientific and psychological studies in lay terms that are accessible to anyone."  -- Los Angeles, California<P>


                    "<STRONG>This is a book that could save the World</STRONG>. 
                    This book presents a mind-blowing revelation on every page, and yet you will recognize
                    everything in it from your everyday life. That is what makes it so chilling. Milgram
                    demonstrates in definitive experiments how typical people recruited from off the street
                    can, using no more than a veneer of authority, easily be persuaded to commit torture
                    and even murder on innocent victims. The book thereby essentially explains the
                    psychological mechanics of the Nazi and other concentration camps, the Death Squads
                    in El Salvador and across the World, and the many other forms of atrocity that have
                    become so characteristic of the 20th Century, this "Century of barbed wire and
                    watchtowers". Ever wonder how you can find air force pilots willing to drop the bombs
                    to start a nuclear holocaust? Answer: It's the easiest thing in the World! A certain
                    percentage of the population will have the proper psychological profile, and you just
                    select them. If psychologists and social scientists really wanted to know what are the
                    ruling principles of civilization and what are the sources of so many of its ills, they'd be
                    running experiments like Milgram's year-round in labs across the planet. Instead, very
                    little work of this kind has since been done. Why? Because it's considered "ethically
                    questionable"! In a classic case of "kill the messenger", the very man who shows us
                    concretely how torture has been so thoroughly integrated into the political structure and
                    who exposes the blatant hypocracy of our rulers, is accused of abusing his subjects and
                    of betraying their trust! In the back of the book Milgram, by the way, faces all ethical
                    objections head-on and refutes them all convincingly. Buy this book if you want to find
                    out what is "really going on", but you may be upset by what you find." -- East Bay, California</BLOCKQUOTE>

                    by Taisuke Mitamura which reminds us that castration was not practiced on men to limit fertility but as a behavioral modification to ensure unquestioning obedience. Testosterone was the problem and ambitious mothers would often hold their boys down while the authority-offending glands were excised. The results proved ideal for Big Body building and the Chinese finally made it a mandatory prerequisite for all bureaucratic employment. We are more evolved today of course, or at least more technically advanced. Today corporate types can keep the meat, because the Big T can now be held in check by fat, fear, stress and environmental hormones.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Pretty dry and technical academic research, but it dramatically illustrates the direct correlation between fear/stress and impotence, timidity and "team spirit"</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Nancho Comment</STRONG><BR>Dr. Sexton traces the fecklessness of the corporate crowd right back to their long years of unnatural imprisonment in chairs, at desks, under tube lights, deadlines and authoritarian oversight. Is that any way to raise a healthy animal, let alone an entire male? Her male reviewers (all veterans of that 16-year docile squat and a wee bit touchy) yipped at her viciously.  Feminists were irked that she focused (sympathetically) on boys and ignored her in turn. A pox on both their houses. It's a good and important book. Exhume it.

                    introducing radical changes in masculine behavior and that the emasculation of
                    contemporary man is due to the increasing overorganization of modern society." </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Nancho Advisory:</STRONG><BR> 
                    Since the Small/Beautiful/Sensual  societies we create in the post-corporate world should directly reflect the democratic will of each of our families, communities and bioregions, there is little point in pushing one-size-fits-all paradigms. You don't need a doctor to tell you how to enjoy your health after the plague is past. As long as we keep the "pathological scale" problem in mind and simply refuse existence to vast hierarchic entities, a diversity of congenial new cultures is thinkable, desirable, probably inevitable. But we have learned a lot about ourselves as a species in the last few thousand years, and that history must be consulted when building our brave new worlds. Kirkpatrick Sale offers an invaluable review of that history in "Human Scale" and clearly outlines what has worked and what hasn't since the days of ancient Greece. His primary conclusion is predictable - Big Sucks (in every bloody sense), but the historical insights he offers into our unsung successes both amaze and encourage. Read this book! You will feel a lot better about both the past and the future.

PHENOMENON OF MAN<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> <B>Nancho Comment<BR>
</B>
Jesuit paleontologist Teilhard de Chardin will eventually be known as the most brilliant prophet of the 20th century and this is his most important work. Written with great learning, grace and profound conviction, <U>The Phenomenon of Man</U> traces the great evolutionary work from the first stirrings of life through our species glorious/pathetic history and onward to quantum consumation in a "Spirit of the Earth." He calls this planetic  convergance the "Noosphere," an all-encompassing  psychic singularity that enhaloes the biosphere and offers each of us a transcendent foundation for individual liberation and becoming. In 1947 Chardin watched the laying of the first Atlantic telecommunications cable and virtually predicted the arising of not only the Internet but also the entire complexifying global neural matrix that would ultimately allow the planet to think its first collective thought. More marvelous still, this is laid out as a self-fulfilling prophecy that we can realistically accomplish in our own lifetimes. The next great stride in evolution is not to be awaited, but accomplished now with science, love and haste. To start generating that spirit now, see the <A href="${BASE_URL}earthour/earthour.html">Earth Hour</A>.

<P><B>Reviews </B><BR>

<P>&quot;Back in 1968, designers Charles and Ray Eames made a 10-minute
documentary film, titled Powers of Ten, showing what the universe looks
like at different scales. Philip and Phylis Morrison were scientific advisors
on the movie and their book translates the film onto paper.</P>

<P> &quot;Starting with a view of a billion light-years, the book (like
the film) moves inward, with each page being at one-tenth the scale of
the previous one. In 25 steps, you're looking at a picnic by the shores
of Lake Michigan, then plunging into a human hand, down through the cells
inside it, the DNA inside the cells, the atoms inside the DNA, and the
subatomic particles inside the atom. By the time you've gone a total of
40 steps, you're in a world of quantum uncertainty.&quot; --Mary Ellen
Curtin </P>

<P><B>Reader Comments<BR>
</B>&quot;This book
must be in every home, every school and every college. It is enough to
read this one book to have faith and admiration for science at the same
time developing a deep respect for the Power behind the universe which
most of us call God... One of the first ten books
which will still be remembered at the 'end' of the twenty-first century
as the legacy of the twentieth.&quot; - Palo Alto, CA</P>

<P> Brilliant! &quot;This is not only a beautiful book to look at, it is
an intellectual treasure, sharing some of science's most profound discoveries
with the reader. I can't reccomend this book enough. It turns the world
into a dream.&quot; - Auckland, New Zealand</P>

<P> <B>Nancho Comment<BR>
</B>Despite a rather distracting narration, the short movie this book describes is one of the most profoundly moving film works ever made. If you can somehow stretch your mind to encompass the literally awesome reality this film/book describes you will never feel the same about life again. From the cosmic or even galactic scale each of our lives is but a microscopic micro-second of energetic jitter, yet viewed from the perspective of our quantum or even atomic constituents, each of us is also an impossibly vast and stately universe of time and space. By ripsawing our minds between these two contradictary and equally true realities, the film exposes us to the singular magic of our green Middle Kingdom and the profound power our consciousness should wield in this realm. Although this is all just "simple" science that everybody "knows", when you try to actually/vividly envision it,  the entire world begins to glow. Use it as a meditation if you ever lose heart in some Big Body battle. The power that it confers is positively invincible.

<BR>" An invaluable teaching resource. There is probably no better way to introduce the non-scientist to the philosophical implications of the emerging 'quantum' worldview. As a mathematical cosmologist, Brian understands the details behind the amazing revelations of the 'new physics' and with unique talent weaves a wonderful tale of the complementary meaning we must see in these details. I have used this book as a primary text in courses I have taught in science and society and years later had students recall with great fondness the sense of awe, spirit and personal vision it awakened in them. This is not another work of the nice but limited science-and -religion-are-the-same school, but a truly deep and accessable presentation of the new scientific worldview that combines technical understanding with spiritual meaning. A true gem that educates and inspires hope!" - Collingwood, Canada<P>

&quot;Awe-inspiring
explanation of life, meaning, and existence. As a supplement to the thoughts
of Lonergan, Ursula Franklin, Thomas Aquinas, and Plato, this book serves
to put into poetic terms the dance of physics, biology, cognitive thought,
creation, evolution, spirituality, psychology, love, life, death, meaning,and essentially everything else this universe holds. It was interesting
to see this work done in the matter of the dialogues - it worked for the
Greeks for teaching difficult topics. The book holds much more meaning
if you have already studied concepts of life, such as those expressed by
Lonergan. The reader is really forced to think in a completely different
manner in order to understand Swimme's thoughts. You look at everything
differently after reading this; you gain a new love of life and in the
process become more human. I would whole-heartedly recommend this book
to anyone with an interest in life and existence, no matter what your background
knowledge is. Best thing out there!&quot; - Vancouver, Canada</A></LI></BLOCKQUOTE>
