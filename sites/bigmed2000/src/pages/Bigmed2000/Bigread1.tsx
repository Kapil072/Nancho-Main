<STRONG>Review</STRONG>
<BR>&quot;Beginning in the 1960s, social, economic, and political observers
have expressed concern over the role of multinational corporations. As
the global economy has evolved, it is the transnational corporation that
provokes apprehension. In The New Realities (1989), Peter Drucker issued
the early warning that the advent of the transnational company heralded
a structural change in the world economy. Now Korten sounds loud the alarm.
He blames the corporate quest for short-term financial gain for creating
a 'market tyranny that is extending its reach across the planet like a
cancer, colonizing ever more of the planet's living spaces, destroying
livelihoods, displacing people, rendering democratic institutions impotent,
and feeding on life.' The solution, he argues, is to 're-create societies
that nurture cultural and biological diversity [and get] corporations out
of politics...' Korten's critique and his solutions are bold and unequivocal.&quot;
- David Rouse t&copy; 1995<P>
This is a 'must-read' book - a searing indictment of an unjust international
economic order, not by a wild-eyed idealistic left-winger, but by a sober
scion of the establishment with impeccable credentials. It left me devastated
but also very hopeful. Something can be done to create a more just economic
order. - Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu</P>

</B>Analysis based on facts that are difficult to dispute This was an excellent
and thought provoking book. They challenge the assumption that big is better
by showing fact after fact after fact that proves otherwise. The best part
of the book is that, unlike most management, business, and economic texts,
it isn't just theoretical philosophizing with no basis in reality. Every
chapter is laden with dozens of references to real world events and published
facts. If only the Bigness apologists had so much evidence it would be
easier to take them seriously.... Chicago, Illinois </P>

POST-CORPORATE WORLD : LIFE AFTER CAPITALISM<BR>
</FONT></A></B>by David C. Korten </LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Reviews<BR>
</B>&quot;In his bestselling 1995 call to arms, <U>When Corporations Rule
the World</U>, David C. Korten first attempted to raise public consciousness
about the potentially disastrous consequences of economic globalization
and the expansion of corporate power. Now, in his provocative new work,
The Post-Corporate World: Life After Capitalism, he goes further by defining
these dual ills as a collective cancer that will ultimately destroy the
larger society upon which they actually depend for survival.</P>

<P> &quot;Containment of this cancer, Korten suggests, is a wholly inadequate
remedy. Rather, a &quot;curative regime&quot;--consisting of measures aimed
at &quot;virtually eliminating the institution of the limited liability
for-profit public corporation as we know it&quot;--is necessary to save
us from an otherwise inevitable fate. The book opens with Korten's downbeat
view of capitalism infecting &quot;democracy, markets and life itself.&quot;
Its following three sections are much more optimistic, however, as he focuses
on ways both individuals and the community can reorganize their institutional
and policy choices to &quot;eliminate the economic pathology that plagues
us and create truly democratic, market-based, life-centered societies.&quot;
Only by intentionally building this radical new post-corporate world, he
boldly proposes, will a sustainable community be created that truly meets
our future needs.&quot; --Howard Rothman </P>

<P>&quot;In the '80s, capitalism defeated communism. Now it has defeated
democracy, we are informed by Korten (When Corporations Rule the World,
1995). Capitalism is inimical to life, he declares, and he thinks, naturally
enough, that life is better. The author, a former Harvard Business School
teacher, depicts the doleful condition on our sad little planet. He objects
to the wayward thinking of proponents of what he calls a \`\`dead universe''
governed by inhumanly impersonal corporations. Midas was wrong. Life and
money do not mix. Humanity, as a functioning organism, can make a better
choice. It can reject the power of international business, bent on amassing
hegemony and cash at any cost. Corporations, to put it baldly, are soul
destroying and inherently evil. They are merging and metastasizing worldwide.
The unfortunate current primacy of cash returns to shareholders bodes ill.
Corporations destroy natural assets and human institutions and exploit
workersthis is the authors angry preachment.... Reject NAFTA, the WTO,
and the IMF as ultimately destructive forces. Corporations should not,
as is presently the case, be accorded the status of personhood or be recipients
of governmental largess.&quot; -- &copy;1999, Kirkus Associates. </P>

<P><B>Book Description <BR>
</B>In this book, David Korten makes a compelling and well-documented case
that capitalism's claims to being the engine of wealth creation, the champion
of democracy, and the embodiment of the market economy are unfounded. Among
Korten's conclusions: Capitalism is a pathology that afflicts democracies
and market economies in the absence of vigilant public oversight. The consolidation
of economic power under a handful of global mega-corporations is a victory
for central planning - not the market economy. The alternative to the new
global capitalism is a planetary system of democratically governed market
economies that honor basic market principles of the sort actually advocated
by Adam Smith.</P>

<P> <B>Reader Comment<BR>
</B>&quot;Korten's hope is that biology's recent findings about healthy
ecosystems might clarify our visions of a healthy economy and its present
corporate &quot;disease.&quot; How else to describe a predatory pseudo-lifeform
which starves natural innovation and resistance (as by monopolizing markets
and buying politicians), extracts life materials from its host (such as
clean water, expertise, and time) for strictly monetary ends, while externalizing
its wastes and costs (the &quot;downsized,&quot; the permanent underclass,
dead land, pollution) to the public?</P>

<P> &quot;Korten fills out the book with stories of people who are trying
to promote &quot;life values&quot; in the economy, and suggestions for
more coherent and coordinated personal action. He traces the history of
&quot;corporate rights&quot; in America and the legal fiction that corporations
are &quot;persons&quot; under the law; and he illustrates a few images
of how a post-corporate market economy might work...&quot; - New York,

</B>&quot;The corporation, by its nature, is as blind as it is powerful.
Spiritually blind, morally blind. As a collective entity, it is worse than

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Synopsis<BR>
</B>The 43 essays in this collection comprise a point-by-point analysis
of globalization and its consequences. Among the highlights: William Greider
examines how General Electric works to shape (with the goal of controlling)
the political arena; Ralph Nader and Lori Wallach attack NAFTA and GATT
for undermining the sovereign authority of democratic governments; and
Wendell Berry looks at the concerted efforts of big business to destroy
local, particularly rural, communities in order to plunder the environment
without opposition. Several authors, including Satish Kumar, Jeanette Armstrong,
and Kirkpatrick Sale, outline alternatives to the global economy based
on &quot;bioregional&quot; principles of local self-sufficiency. </P>

<P><B>Book Description <BR>
</B>A great political debate is emerging over the many unexpected and profound
consequences of the rush toward the global economy and its effects on jobs,
human rights, cultural diversity, democracy, and the natural world. The
world's political and corporate leaders are restructuring the planet's
economic and political arrangements in ways that directly affect humans
and the environment more than anything since the Industrial Revolution.
New, giant globalizing institutions such as the World Trade Organization,
GATT, and the World Bank, created with scant public debate or scrutiny,
have moved real power away from citizen democracies and nation states to
global corporate bureaucracies, with grave results. </P>

                    Contrary to the popular conception of members of the press as hard-bitten realists
                    doggedly pursuing unpopular truths, Herman and Chomsky prove conclusively that the

                "Should Be Standard Educational Text <BR>
                    This magnificently researched academic study by Herman and Chomsky is a milestone
                    and should be studied by the editorial staff of every newspaper in the western
                    "democracies." It's a challenging read, given our collective assumptions about other
                    people and other cultures and the "role" of the United States in world affairs. And it's
                    especially tough to digest in the face of the media's ongoing campaign to propagate
                    those very assumptions, false though they may be, to their audiences. Manufacturing
                    Consent is well worth the time and energy." -- Raleigh, North Carolina</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

                    "If we believe that an informed populace is an integral part of a successfully active
                    democracy, writes Robert W. McChesney, then the commercial basis of U.S. media, in
                    which a substantial number of media outlets are owned by a handful of corporations, is
                    definite cause for concern. When corporations control the flow of information, he
                    suggests, they will inevitably do so in a way that promotes their own interests over
                    those of the citizenry. From an analysis of the corporate influence over the 1934
                    Communications Act to a discussion of how media convergence might kill off hope of
                    the Internet bringing about a revolution, he debunks the myth of an objective, liberal
                    media and emphasizes the belief that issues of media ownership should be treated as
                    matters of public policy rather than strictly business." -- Amazon.com</BLOCKQUOTE>

<STRONG>Synopsis </STRONG><BR>


                    When the first edition of The Media Monopoly was published in 1983, critics called
                    Ben Bagdikian's warnings about the chilling effects of corporate ownership and mass
                    advertising on the nation's news "alarmist." Since then, the number of corporations
                    controlling most of America's daily newspapers, magazines, radio, television, books,
                    and movies has dropped from fifty to ten. This new edition explores the political
                    implications of this stunning shift, the impact of the Internet and other new media, and
                    the effects of corporate media control on the news and entertainment that Americans
                    see and hear. "An eye-opening attack on the growing concentration of major

                    "Media scholars and critics will welcome this revision of an insightful and provocative
                    examination of increasing concentration in U.S. mass media and the effects of mass
                    advertising, not only on media content, but also on the functioning of American
                    democracy. Teachers of media and society will want to consider this as required

<P><B>Synopsis<BR>
</B>While Hollywood has replaced politics with silly diversions about alien
invasions, many Americans face a tangible fear: the seemingly inexorable
grip of corporate power over their lives. Wages have been dropping for
twenty years. Income inequality that grew under Reagan and Bush has accelerated
under Clinton. More and more people face an uncertain future as the &quot;land
of opportunity&quot; becomes a cynical and empty phrase for millions of
Americans. This hard-hitting anthology offers an incisive overview of how
corporations, long plunderers of the Third World, are unleashing &quot;market
forces&quot; like a pack of rabid dogs attacking the American way of life.</P>

A scathing
rebuttal to the &quot;Newtification&quot; of America, and hilarious proof
of why Michael Moore is the unofficial champion of the largest political
force in the nation--the 60 percent of voters who elect not to vote -- <U>Downsize
This!</U> gets under the skin of the corporations, politicians, and media moralists
who have made life miserable for millions of Americans. <P>
<P><B>Review<BR>
</B>From  If you
don't know Michael Moore, you should. The creator of Roger and Me and TV
Nation has built his career on giving the raspberry to corporate fat cats,
and this book will add to his considerable reputation. He tackles everyone
here--Democrats, Republicans, Germany, General Motors--and wrestles them
to the ground. About the only one who doesn't get thoroughly dissed is
O. J., whom Moore claims is far too rich to bother killing anyone. Among
the book's stellar moments: the introduction of his &quot;big welfare mamas&quot;
--that is, &quot;tax-cheating, job-exporting, environment-destroying corporations
that are already posting record profits&quot; ; his letters to Norway and
the Netherlands asking for foreign aid for America's poor; and his poignant
support of those countless billions of abandoned sperm, mindlessly disposed
of in a convenient Kleenex. Moore's wit is as dry as a martini and as outrageous
as, well . . . a hugely profitable company laying off thousands of workers.
This is a book that makes you think as hard as you laugh.

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG><BR> 
A radio commentator and former Texas
commissioner of agriculture offers his no-holds-barred, populist views
on American politics and culture, showing how the government, the media,
and large corporations have foreclosed on the American dream...
Hightower is mad
as hell and he's not going to take it anymore! He's also funny as hell,
and in this book he focuses his sharp Texas wit, populist passion, and
native smarts on America's political, economic, scientific, and media establishments.
In <U>There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road But Yellow Stripes and Dead
Armadillos</U>, Hightower shows not only what's wrong, but also how to fix
it, offering specific solutions and calling for a new political movement
of working families and the poor to &quot;take America back from the bankers
and bosses, the big shots and bastards.&quot; <P>

<STRONG>Blurbs</STRONG><BR>
&quot;If you don't read another book about what's wrong
with this country for the rest of your life, read this one. I think it's
the best and most important book about out public life I've read in years.&quot;

<STRONG>Reader Response</STRONG><BR> Read about the
unbridled power of big corporations. He has great examples that make you
think about the power of corporations in America and the world. Does it
really make any sense that the DOW goes up, after big corporations lay
people off? If it does, then what does the DOW represent? Read about his
suggestion for the Doug Jones Average which would really indicate how life
is working for the average person. Nothing about the corporate world will
seem benign after you finish this book. -- palo alto, california </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

</B>Can't believe this is of all books is out of print! It's one of the
greatest books ever written on the rise of Corporate Power and and the
gangrenous death of Classical Economics' Invisible Hand. Although Galbraith
unfortunately knows no biology, he describes the gross physiology of Big
Bodies with great analytical clarity and explains why their pullulating
fraternity (aka The Planning System) both dominates social reality and
is beyond current human control. Read in tandem with any work on slime
mold physiology (e.g., <A href="${BASE_URL}bigmed2000/bigbody/lusions1.html">Lusions</A>), you
can begin to understand what we are up against and yet see a tantalizing
bio-allegorical light at the end of the long corporate night.</P>

<P><B>Nancho Comment<BR>
</B>This polished indictment of corporate crime, pathology and malfeasance
was supposed to be the capstone of Galbraith's definitive trilogy on Corporate
Culture and the Collapse of Classical/Neo-classical Economics. After the
The Affluent Society, which diagnosed our fatal susceptibility to material
addictions, and The New Industrial State, which dissected the awesome invisible
power of the Pushers, Economics and the Public Purpose was to have offered
the Cure. The first two-thirds of the book is an insightful treasure, documenting
the great corporate bodies' baleful effects on families, women, sports,
arts, media, human rights, you name it. Unfortunately, Dr. G flinched in
the finale and could not bring himself to pronounce the only reasonable
course of treatment: Eradicate the Bastards. When I asked him why (after
the book itself had died a quick grisly death from its cowardly conclusion),
he got extremely upset and bellowed, &quot;I have NEVER been a hopeless
romantic!&quot; But you still can be! Find a copy, read the first 212 pages,
and draw your own romantic conclusions...</P>

</B>A counter attack against the un-emotional, profit driven pseudo-science
that staunch capitalists spout as if pure Capitalism and the so-called
&quot;free market&quot; were the only option this world has... Some level
of emotion is needed to help the people of the world achieve some level
of economic and social equality. The rapidly growing gap between rich and
poor is an obvious result of the type of socialism for the wealthy and
capitalism for the poor that exists in this country, and this book does
a good job of exemplifying the extreme consequences of this situation.
Besides, Capitalism is just a eco-philosophical theory espoused as science.

</B>Global Spin reveals the sophisticated techniques being used around
the world by powerful conservative forces to try to change the way the

are using their influence to reshape public opinion, to weaken gains made
by environmentalists, and to turn politicians against increased environmental
regulation. Global Spin shows how, in a relentless assault on democracy
and its institutions, the massive, covert power of large corporations has
enabled corporate agendas to dominate the international debate about the

<P><B>Review<BR>
</B>&quot;While members of the press and punditry were crawling all over
each other to talk about Bill Clinton's sex life throughout 1998, other
things were happening that you may not have heard about. Like the American
government's repeated noncompliance with the UN's comprehensive test ban
treaty on nuclear weapons. Or Nigerian soldiers being helicoptered to a
Chevron facility by the company, shooting at a group of student demonstrators
there, and killing two of them. Or that recently declassified documents
suggest that--despite what we were told in the '50s--the fluoride in our
water might not be so safe after all. Catch up on these and other stories
the mainstream media never quite got around to reporting. Censored 1999
also has updates on coverage of the top underreported stories of 1998,
a guide to online news resources, and several cartoons by Tom Tomorrow
skewering the established media perspective.&quot; -- Ron Hogan</P>

<P> <B>Book Description</B> <BR>
Compiled by the Project Censored staff under the directorship of Peter
Phillips, with over 150 student researchers, faculty, media scholars, and
critics, Censored 1999 stands in stark contrast to the news reported by
the major networks or the daily newspapers. This year's collection features:
Luke Hiken with the National Lawyers Guild on the First Amendment and pirate
radio stations in the U.S.; Steve Wilson and Jane Akre on Fox News and
the controversial Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH) story ; &quot;Censored Dja
Vu&quot; -- Censored stories from previous years that have since received
mainstream coverage; and &quot;Junk Food News&quot; -- The most over-covered,
least newsworthy stories that dominated the media at the expense of real
news. Also included are the &quot;Censored Resource Guide,&quot; &quot;Censored
Guide to On-line Resources,&quot; and &quot;Alternative Writer's Market.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Synopsis<BR>
</B>All the news that didn't make the news--from two decades of bird-dogging
the media! Here are over 200 of the most censored and vital news stories
that were largely neglected by the mass media when they were timely, and
what has happened to them since. Jensen not only reports on the issues
behind the news stories, but he follows the stories behind the stories,
analyzing the ways in which corporate capitalism, &quot;herd mentality&quot;,
and laziness combine to influence and direct levels of media involvement.
</P>

<P>Based on the work of Project Censored, the nation's longest running
media research project, 20 Years of Censored News reveals, year by year,
the news stories neglected by the mass media when they were timely and
lets us know what has happened to them since. From 1976 to 1995, the book
provides an overview of the most censored news stories and issues of the
past two decades. Of the 200 stories presented, less than 25 percent ever
received the attention they deserve in the press. A disturbing report card
of the media's long-term performance, one which the media did not pass,
20 Years of Censored News is a fierce indictment of the national news media's
failure to keep the public informed.</P>

<P> <B>Reader Comment<BR>
</B>&quot;This is a scholarly, thoughtful dissertation encompassing not
only issues of monopolization of the American press by huge multinational
corporations, but many other issues ignored by mainstream media: environmentalism,
nuclear power, government surveillance and other infringements on the civil
rights of the world's citizens. This book is an essential collection of
modern history so carefully hidden from the vast majority of Americans.&quot;
