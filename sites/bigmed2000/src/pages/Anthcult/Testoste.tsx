<BLOCKQUOTE>WASHINGTON (Jun 20, 1995 - 08:54 EDT) -- Tired of hormone as cultural myth,
as shorthand for swagger and machismo, ferocity and obnoxiousness, the
bearskin beneath the three-piece suit?<P>

Do the ubiquitous references to "testosterone poisoning" and "testosterone
shock," to "testosterone-fueled heavy metal" and 'testosterone-crazed
oppressors" make you feel a bit, well, testy?<P>

Do you think it unfair to blame one lousy little chemical for war,
dictatorships, crime, Genghis Khan, Gunga Din, Sly Stallone, the NRA, the
NFL, Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf and the tendency to interrupt in the
middle of a sentence?<P>

Ready to give the so-called male hormone a break and retire all
testosterone cliches with a single pound of Iron John's drum?<P>

Retire away. As it turns out, testosterone may not be the dread "hormone of
aggression" that researchers and the popular imagination have long had it.
It may not be the substance that drives men to behave with quintessential
guyness, to posture, push, yelp, belch, punch and play air-guitar.<P>

If anything, this most freighted of hormones may be a source of very
different sensations: calmness, happiness and friendliness, for example.<P>

Friendliness???<P>

Reporting in Washington last week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine
Society, researchers said that it was a deficiency of testosterone, rather
than its excess, that could lead to all the negative behaviors normally
associated with the androgen.<P>

Studying a group of 54 so-called hypogonadal men, who for a variety of
reasons were low in testosterone, Dr. Christina Wang of the University of
California in Los Angeles and her colleagues, found that before treatment,
the men expressed a surprising suite of negative emotions.<P>

They did not feel passive or depressed or timid, as standard ideas of
testosterone deficiency might predict. Instead, they described feelings of
edginess, anger, irritability. Aggression.<P>

When the men were given testosterone replacement therapy, and were asked to
complete questionnaires about their moods several times over the course of
two months of treatment, their general sense of well-being improved
markedly. Their anger and agitation decreased, their sense of optimism and
friendliness heightened.<P>

"Every parameter we looked at went in the same direction," Dr. Wang said.
"The positive mood increased, the negative mood decreased."<P>

Dr. Willis K. Samson, a professor and chairman of physiology at the
University of North Dakota School of Medicine, said, "Testosterone has been
given such a negative knock. Work like this helps show the up side of this
very important male hormone."<P>

The commonly held belief that testosterone produces antisocial behavior
"may be a misconception," he added.<P>

Dr. Wang's work is in keeping with similar findings from other laboratories
that question how relevant testosterone is to human aggression.<P>

Some studies even indicate another, improbable source of aggression:
estrogen. Yes, the gal hormone.<P>

Other work presented at the meeting showed that when male mice were
genetically deprived of their ability to respond to estrogen, they lost a
lot of their natural aggressiveness, becoming much less likely to fight
with other males or to display the general paranoia exhibited by ordinary
male rodents.<P>

Considered together, the new work underscores how primitive is scientists'
understanding of the effects of hormones on human and even animal behavior.<P>

Testosterone was first isolated nearly half a century ago, yet its
influence on the brain and behavior remains largely a matter of creative
speculation.<P>

"It's more an art form than a science form," particularly when it comes to
human research, said Dr. William J. Bremner, an endocrinologist at the
Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Washington.<P>

What is not open to debate is that to call testosterone or any of the
related androgens "male" hormones, or to call estrogens "female" hormones
is a misnomer: both sexes possess some amounts of each other's hormones.<P>

But they differ considerably in the relative amount circulating through the
blood.<P>

In the case of testosterone, women on average have about 40 nanograms of
the hormone per deciliter of blood, and a score of 120 would rank as
extremely high (and very likely result in hirsutism, acne and other
problems of excess androgens).<P>

Men, by contrast, normally have anywhere from 300 to 1,000 nanograms of
testosterone per per deciliter, or 10 times a woman's concentration.<P>

This discrepancy explains in part why testosterone has been tagged as the
hormone of aggression. Men have so much more of it than women -- more of it
than women have of estrogen relative to males. Men also commit the vast
majority of violent crimes and get into many more accidents than do women.<P>

There has been other evidence implicating testosterone as the bearer of
brutality. When scientists inject laboratory animals with testosterone,
male and female animals alike respond with more aggressive behavior,
becoming more likely to attack intruders or to begin mounting anything that
moves.<P>

Moreover, some studies of prison populations, wife beaters or other groups
considered hostile and foul-tempered, suggest that aggressive men have
comparatively high testosterone levels.<P>

And then there are those football players or weight-lifters who take
super-high doses of anabolic steroids -- synthetic androgens -- in an
attempt to build strength and muscle mass. Often, such men report feeling
prepared to go out and puree their opponents.<P>

But scientists are beginning to question the relevance of animal behavioral
studies to human emotions, and even to wonder what subsidiary effects the
testosterone injections could be having on laboratory animals to explain
their increased aggression.<P>

As for the human studies, they are contradictory and open to various
interpretations. For example, stress can affect hormone levels in ways that
are only now being mapped out; and prisoners are likely to be under
extremes of stress.<P>

Dr. Wang notes that while competitive athletes may report feeling
pugilistic on anabolic steroids, "this is a highly select group of subjects
with a particular psychological makeup." And the drugs they take are not
native testosterone, but usually a synthesized mix of androgens, with who
knows what effect coming from each.<P>

So far, there have been no good, controlled studies seeking to evaluate the
effect of giving excess testosterone to androgenically normal men. In lieu
of such studies are recent experiments comparing the mood states of
hypogonadal men before and after treatment, like Dr. Wang's work.<P>

One missing element of this report, however, is a conventional control
group -- seeing what happens to men with low testosterone if they are given
a dummy medication rather than real testosterone. Do they, too, feel
happier and friendlier?<P>

Such an experiment would be unethical, said Dr. Wang, because hypogonadal
men who visit the clinic are ill and need treatment to restore muscle and
bone mass and healthy cholesterol levels. Denying them testosterone would
be like denying a diabetic insulin.<P>

Offering a partial explanation, Bremner and his colleagues reported in the
June 1994 issue of The Journal of Clinical and Endocrinological Metabolism
their results of seeing what happens to healthy men when they are
artificially and temporarily brought to a state of low testosterone.<P>

Some of the subjects were immediately given testosterone replacement, while
others received dummy medication.<P>

The study was mainly intended to look at the effects of testosterone on
libido, but the researchers noted that the men with a drug-induced state of
hypogonadism reported increased levels of aggression.<P>

"Perhaps it made them uncomfortable or unhappy in a variety of ways, and
that unhappiness registered itself as a high score on the aggression
scale," Bremner said.<P>

What Bremner's study and other reports found that does conform to
stereotypical notions of the male hormone is that testosterone is
profoundly important to a man's sex drive, though not to his mechanical
abilities in bed.<P>

Hypogonadal men report a sharp drop in sexual interest, which testosterone
replacement quickly restores. The androgen may also play a role in female
sexuality, and a growing number of menopausal women are asking that
testosterone be added to their hormone replacement regimen to restore a
lackluster libido. But the data linking sex drive and testosterone in women
are fiercely debated.<P>

Testosterone therapy also appears to give men and women more energy, vim,
the desire to leap out of bed in the morning and embrace the demands of the
day with can-do concentration. That zestiness is not the same as
aggression, which if anything is often accompanied by poor concentration
and underlying malaise, researchers said.<P>

If testosterone qua testosterone is not the demonic potion of legend, its
yangian counterpart, estrogen, may not be so innocent.<P>

Reporting last month at the annual meeting of the American Pediatric
Society, Dr. Jordan W. Finkelstein, Dr. Howard Kulin and their colleagues
at Penn State University said that they compared the effects of giving
estrogen therapy to girls who suffered from delayed onset of puberty with
that of giving testosterone to boys who likewise were late in sexually
maturing.<P>

The girls showed earlier and larger increases in aggression than did the
boys, until the boys received the last and highest dose of testosterone.<P>

The researchers propose that for both sexes, the cause of the teen-age
spike in aggressive and very likely insolent behavior is estrogen.<P>

As scientists only lately are beginning to appreciate, most of the effect
of testosterone on the brain is paradoxically estrogenic in nature.<P>

That is because the brain is rich in the enzyme aromatase, which converts
testosterone into estrogen. The newly transformed hormone then acts on the
nerve cells of the brain through estrogen receptors, proteins designed
specifically to link up with it.<P>

A male's brain also has some receptors for testosterone, but they are far
fewer in number or distribution, and the converting enzyme aromatase does
not leave much testosterone around to hook up with these androgen receptors
anyway.<P>

Thus, in both boys and girls, as they reach adolescence and their
respective sex hormones surge, the influence of either hormone on the brain
and behavior probably works its dark art as estrogen.<P>

In the Pennsylvania study, the girls may have had a jump on aggressive
behavior over the boys because they were given direct injections of
estrogen and therefore their brains did not need to go through the work of
converting testosterone to estrogen.<P>

The centrality of the brain's estrogen receptors to aggressive behavior was
highlighted by a new study of receptor-deficient mice, presented at the
endocrine meeting.<P>

Dr. Donald W. Pfaff of Rockefeller University in New York, his student,
Sonoko Ogawa, and Dr. Kenneth S. Korach of the National Institutes of
Health, have analyzed male mice genetically altered so that they lack
nearly all estrogen receptors.<P>

Testing the male mice in a variety of circumstances, the researchers
determined that they were unusual in many ways. Normal male mice do not
tend to wander across open fields as females do, but prefer to skulk along
borders; males without estrogen receptors generally took the female
attitude, and freely walked where they pleased.<P>

Ordinary males respond to intruders in their territory with violent
attacks, chasing, biting and generally seeking to harm the interloper.
These males react to newcomers tepidly if at all, perhaps nipping if the
animal comes too close, but never attacking the stranger outright.<P>

Significantly, the altered males still have all their androgen receptors
intact. It is only the ability of their brain to respond to estrogen that
is defective.<P>

The researchers have yet to report on the behavior of female mice lacking
estrogen receptors. Those results will probably break a few paradigms of
their own.<P>

Until then, perhaps it is time for a new hormonal cliche to explain
aggression. How about this: The estrogen was so thick you couldn't beat it
down with a rolling pin.<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
