<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000> Like those gifted with a genius for languages, music or art, some precious few of us are blessed with strange insights into "how to do things better." If you were endowed with such an inventive spirit and care about the Big war we're in, pray focus for a moment on our cause.  You may see strategies or solutions we never even dreamed of and would certainly love to hear. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="A/pursuits">Trivial Pursuits</A><HR WIDTH=240 ALIGN=left SIZE=2></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000> Whatever your particular talent or obsession, pursued with intensity, it will often turn magical or at least inexplicable in your hands. Given that ours is an evolutionary war against the agents of consumptive conformity, these miscellaneous flashes of genius light the way to another future in which our individual gifts are nourished with more reverence. The story of  your  art's becoming and the flashes of wonder along the way offer an important testament of our nearness to "Otherness" and greater reason to trust in our own non-corporate devices. In other words, please share the lessons of thy path. <P>In a similar upper chakra vein, see Charles Tart's fascinating <A HREF="http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/tart/taste/" target="_blank">TASTE</A> - The Archives of Scientists' Transcendent Experiences.<P>And, of course, if thy gifts happen to have any anti-corporate utility, pray apply them to the cause with dispatch and flair.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000>Though roughly 90% of scientific research today is funded with an eye to Big Body needs and profits, there are still brave mavericks at large working on projects that would help decentralize, democratize and "Green" technology (e.g., cold fusion, web-based education, energy medicine, etc.). Such concepts will be crucial in the post-Big Body era and we would appreciate hearing about the most promising ones now.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000>Inspired spin doctors, flacks and marketing prodigies all have a preternatural sense of what "the public" is prepared to embrace and how to nestle their message there. Since we are marketing inconvenient truths that many sentient adults are half aware of but have somehow agreed to ignore, we have a problem. If these people feign surprise at our Big Body revelations, they can feel hypocritical, stupid or traitorous to their own intuitions. If they admit they suspected as much all along, they may appear cowardly in the eyes of their children. How do we return these truths to such peoples' grasp guilt-free and ready for action? You tell us...

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000> Beyond the remedial help needed with this primitive site, we just need to know you are out there and able to swiftly navigate Big nervous systems if ever the need arises.  Although we intend to encourage Big Body "fruition" or voluntary break up whenever possible, there will doubtless be holdouts, especially in the more nostalgically fascist regions of the world. We thus strenuously hope that you and your seditiously skilled brethren are all training to reach out and touch someone, particularly some ones that are Big, distant and despotic. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000>Those of you who have reverenced this world and tasted its liberating power already know why it is banned or systematically degraded in every hierarchic society. Just as the ancient saints used sexual metaphors to describe their union with the Divine, you too must help us remember how to exploit that grace, not as a sport or delicious sin, but as the highest, fastest road to sacred compassion. (See "<A href="${BASE_URL}tantra/tangrail.html">Meditations on the Tantric Grail</A>".) Any references, links or ideas for reviving that awareness would be lavishly appreciated.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT  COLOR=#6F0000> Given the high correlation between the use of soft drugs &amp; psychedelics and political resistance to the dominant corporate/consumption paradigm, it is not strange that so much force, money and prison space has been allocated to suppress them.

For the sake of Big Medicine, the greater good, and your own self-respect, also help the <A HREF="http://www.drcnet.org/"  target="_blank">Drug Reform Coordination Network</A> or other groups like <A HREF="http://www.norml.org/" target="_blank">Norml</A> working to end this nightmare. </FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>
