<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Until last month</STRONG>, Kashmir seemed just another obscure, intractable ethnic
conflict. But now that India and Pakistan have tested nuclear weapons, the
dispute over their border region of lush valleys and jagged Himalayan
peaks has become a matter of urgent concern. Three wars have been fought
over Kashmir in the last 50 years. The United States and other countries
can help defuse tensions, but India and Pakistan must make a new attempt
to sort out their differences now that these divisions could become the
pretext for a nuclear war.<P>

The conflict over Kashmir began with Britain's hasty retreat from empire,
which left India and Pakistan to fight over its status. That fight has
since become an emotional test of principle and identity. As India's only
Muslim state, Jammu and Kashmir, as it is officially called, has been torn
by an insur-rection that has cost 20,000 lives in the last decade and
pinned down a major portion of India's armed forces. This month,
guerrillas seeking independence for the state have ambushed two weddings,
leaving more than two dozen people dead, and blown up a train.<P>

India argues that ceding Kashmir would in effect repudiate its efforts to
forge a multi-ethnic state. Pakistan rejects India's possession of
Kash-mir as illegitimate, a freak of history that resulted because the
state's Hindu maharajah chose India at the time of independence.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Since the beginning of the dispute, the United States and other outsiders
have backed the United Nations' demand for a plebiscite. India rejects
that approach, and many Muslims in other parts of the country fear that if
Kashmir were somehow lost, they would be subjected to violent retaliation
by Hindus. Most surveys show that the Kashmiris themselves want
independence. But Pakistan, which controls a chunk of the state on its
own, is no more interested in losing territory to a newly independent
country than India is.<P>

In the post-cold-war era, a handful of ethnic conflicts have been eased by
negotiations that could provide an example for Kashmir. As proposed by
independent experts, the first priority would be to end violence and begin
disarming Kashmiri rebels and Indian forces while Pakistan withdraws its
support for the insurrection. Kashmir should itself move toward more
autonomy, if not outright independence. Ultimately, some political
relationship with both India and Pakistan could be negotiated -along the
lines of the recent agreement in Northern Ireland. Another essential
ingredient would be a pullback by Indian and Pakistani forces on the
border, a cease-fire and exchanges of military information between the two
countries. They should aim as well for a freeze of any plans to deploy
nuclear weapons or test missiles that could be used to deliver them.

These steps would not only assure both countries that they can resolve
their differences peacefully. They would also ease the world's fear that a
remote but savage ethnic and religious conflict could deteriorate into a
nuclear exchange with global consequences. Russia and China have close
ties to India and Pakistan respectively, and they can join with the United
States in helping to ease tensions. But in the end it is India and
Pakistan that must learn to talk to each other and move toward a more
trusting relationship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
