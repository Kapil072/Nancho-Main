If there be a principle that ought not to be questioned <BR>

by which the United States hold their existence as a nation.</FONT></STRONG>"<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><U>FOUNDATION</U><BR>
A truly democratic platform is largely a do-it-ourselves project since we the people are still theoretically in charge. Although we have slipped pretty damn far from that theory of late, our sovereign power abides, and with it our Constitutional duty to defend our hard-won freedoms from all threats foreign and domestic. This duty is particularly pressing when our government itself is undermined and suborned by antidemocratic bodies of unprecedented power, bodies which have assumed human rights, usurped human sovereignty, and imperiled human health and evolution. Big Medicine therefore bases its platform upon an invitational commitment to radically slash the scale, sway and metastatic spread of Big Bodies within our borders and around the planet. 

<P>
<STRONG><U>PLANKS</U><BR>
Big Med's platform planks are thus largely hewn from Greenish Small-extolling and/or Libertarian timber and many are still being milled. Be warned, however, that we aren't going to promise you a lot of things that we will do "for you" if and when you put "us" into power. Since the whole point is to put you yourselves - the "Sovereign People" - back in control of your homes, communities and common future, our  planks suggest things you yourselves should be doing with or without the aid of our increasingly feckless leaders. As such our platform is more a prescription for emergency self-help than a political promissory note, and thus remains an operative agenda whatever the electoral results. For openers, it generically advises:
<P>
<UL>
<FONT  COLOR=#D20020><LI><DL><U>For Personal Health</U></FONT> <BR><FONT  COLOR=#00006A>- Get Big Bodies out of your bloodstreams. bedrooms and babies' dreams</FONT><DD>

Put Big Bodies on a tax/statute-enforced diet to reduce their inhuman bulk and distance from the Earth, 
while imposing a 12-step program that enforces "Zero Toxic Emissions" within five years.</DL>

</UL>

Although many of these reforms require specific political action, all can be accelerated by the creative activity by NGOs, informal citizen groups and ingenious individuals. The melting of vast social organisms back to human scale, social utility and ecological harmlessness is everybody's business, but government can play a vital role if it is under your control.  We therefore recommend the adoption of following policies at the federal, state and/or local level to both correct the gross distortions that Big Bodies have bequeathed us and re-enchant the future for generations yet to come.

Currently, however, it mainly trains and sorts children for corporate utility and inclusion.<P>

The Big problem with our schools is that they have abandoned personalized education for corporate instruction. To educate once meant to educe or draw out and nurture what was special and worthy in each individual child. To instruct means to insert common structures and standards, so any equally graded child can largely replace any other in the offices and factories of our Big Bodied world. 
<P>
Schools now use overly large classes to suppress individuation and screen for corporate virtues - foremost of which are generic obedience, cheerful subordination, abstract cerebral &amp; memory skills, and the willingness to sit docilely at desks 40 hours a week for years on end. Education of the heart, hand, spirit or senses withers in this environment and those with talents not useful to corporate end users often feel doomed and rebellious from the outset. True education demands far more personalized attention with classes no larger than 12-15 students and intense community involvement/interaction at the secondary level. New curricula must also be introduced which stress:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Personal individuation, maturation and responsibility (e.g., critical thinking, viable post-corporate skills/arts/trades, and techniques for medical/legal/media "self-defense");
<LI>Our indivisible relationship with Nature and the planet (e.g., <A HREF="http://cgee.hamline.edu/see/crs_and_concept/see_essay_role_of_arts.htm#ecological literacy" target="_blank">Eco-literacy</A>, <A HREF="../advisors/vanmatt.html">Earth Education</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.permaculture.net/about/index.html" target="_blank">Permaculture</A>); 
<LI>The extraordinary creative potential and evolutionary importance of focused human attention;  and 
<LI>The threat huge collective entities consistently pose to our cultures, environment and spiritual/sensual/physical well-being.
</UL><P>

Staff and students at high schools, colleges and universities should also be drawn into direct political/social/environmental problem-solving and experimentation. Educational resources and institutions must be mustered at all levels until the Big Body siege is over.</font><P>

<UL>
<LI><DL>Teach basic ovulation awareness and <U>then</U> demand responsibility.</FONT><DD>
<FONT  COLOR=#00006A>The climbing abortion rate is an undeniable tragedy and  the saddest proof that our current system to train minds for corporate inclusion has virtually instructed us right out of our sensual bodies. 40 years of biofeedback studies offer dramatic proof that ordinary people can be quite rapidly trained to consciously feel and control extremely subtle physical processes. Ovulation is hardly a subtle process. It sends torrents of hormones storming through the female body for a few days each month, yet nearly 8 out of 10 of women still don't have a clue when it occurs. Ovulation awareness should be at the compulsory heart of women's physical education, perhaps even a graduation requirement like swimming or gym now is in many secondary schools. Once women know when they are fertile, we can start to talk about "responsibility" and social sanctions for subsequent behavior.</font></DL>

<FONT  COLOR=#D20020><LI><DL><U>Third World Prophylaxis</U> </font><DD>
<FONT  COLOR=#00006A>Since the biggest threat to our common future is arguably the increasing poverty, inequality, desperation and rage in the Third World, our defense policy should target tyrannies of any flavor, Big Body predators, and women. Target tyrannies with elite-distressing actions, predators with stunning tax sanctions, and women with free schooling (since true democracies have never warred upon each other; most inequity and rage are due to Big Exploitation; and  women's education is the only factor that has consistently reduced birth rates always and everywhere). In other words, prioritize democracy, social justice and population control over military preparedness for the violent consequences of inaction.</FONT></DL>

<FONT  COLOR=#D20020>UN REFORM</font>
<UL>
<LI><FONT  COLOR=#00006A>True democratic reform might prove impossible since all members by law, custom and inertia respond solely to government pressure rather than popular will.  Big Med thus advocates the creation of a parallel (and soon predominant) Assembly of United Peoples, all of whose members are directly elected for five-year non-refusable/non-renewable terms by the citizens in each land. As originally suggested by the world's indigenous peoples, this body should be headed by  an Eco-Social Security Council devoted to the protection of the planet's air, water, soil, habitats and human rights. Its decisions should be final on all matters affecting the biosphere, and it should possess enough power to briskly overrule the WTO, GATT and other vestigial Big Body proxies whenever necessary.</FONT>
